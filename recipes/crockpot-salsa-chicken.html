    <h1>Crockpot Salsa Chicken</h1>
    <img src="salsa.jpg" alt="salsa chicken">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is probably THE simplest recipe... ever? A slow cooker meal made with only 4 ingredients is really something to celebrate. The chicken falls apart and becomes immensely tender, flavored with the familiar flavors of chunky salsa and taco seasoning, and brightened up with bursts of lime juice. Serve this over rice, in lettuce cups, or as tacos.  This recipe is the epitome of set it and forget it.</p>
    <p>Want to change it up a little bit? Sub the red salsa for a salsa verde for a totally different flavor and an equally easy dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tsp. taco seasoning mix </li>
        <li>2 c. chunky red salsa</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, for serving  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange chicken breast in slow cooker. Sprinkle all over with taco seasoning mix. Pour 1 cup of the salsa over seasoned chicken. Cover and cook on high for 3 hours (or low for 6-8 hours).</li>
        <li>Use two forks to shred the chicken. Add remaining cup of salsa and toss to coat. </li>
    </ol>
