            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spaghetti</li>
                    <li>150 grams pancetta or bacon</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with water and add a generous amount of salt. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the spaghetti or linguine pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
                    <li>In a separate frying pan, cook the diced pancetta or bacon until it turns crispy and golden brown. Remove the cooked pancetta or bacon from the pan and set it aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated parmesan cheese, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat the rendered fat in the frying pan over medium heat. Add the cooked pasta to the pan and toss it gently to coat the pasta with the fat.</li>
                    <li>Remove the frying pan from the heat and quickly pour the egg mixture over the pasta. Use tongs or a fork to toss the pasta rapidly, ensuring that the eggs coat the pasta evenly.</li>
                    <li>Add back the cooked pancetta or bacon to the pan and continue tossing the pasta for another minute or until the eggs are cooked, but still creamy.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Pasta Carbonara immediately with an additional sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                </ol>
