    <p>When you think Parm + chicken, your brain might go to melty, saucy chicken Parmesan, but we might dig this dish even more. All the flavor from the chicken thighs, butter, garlic, and thyme seep into the tender baby potatoes for a fully satisfying, comforting meal.</p>

        <li>2 tbsp. fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 tbsp.freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
