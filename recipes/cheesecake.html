                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 and 1/2 cups ( 180g) graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet graham crackers)
                            1/4 cup ( 50g) granulated sugar</li>
                            <li>5 Tablespoons ( 71g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
                            <li>32 ounces ( 904g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
                            <li>1 cup ( 200g) granulated sugar</li>
                            <li>1 cup ( 240g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (optional, but recommended)</li>
                            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
                            <li>Make the crust: If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a  food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
                            <li>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can. You will have close to 6 cups of batter.</li>
                        </ol>
